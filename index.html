            <p>
               Being a lifelong learner is a trait that is really important to me, and I know that a good education 
               is not just for the schoolyard. Some lessons were learned in the traditional way, while others I have 
               received from professional mentors, while working and in some cases, friends and family. Read about my 
               education journey and get in touch with any questions.

         <h2>My Reflection</h2>
         <h3>This is a reflection over the course of my education from 2011 - present</h3>
         <p>
             Over the course of my education, I have learned many important skills that will guide me 
             for the rest of my life. I have learned to always set a goal so that I have a direction to 
             follow. I learned to do my best all the time and to ask questions when I don't understand.
             I learned to take responsibility for my actions and to always treat people with the utmost 
             respect. I learn to live life with respect, care, responsibility, integrity, and resilience. 
             Since joining Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I have strengthened my core values and gain maturity. I hope 
             to further learn more and grow my maturity over the next few years at Ngee Ann Polytechnic from my 
             mentors, lecturers, and friends.
